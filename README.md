# Digital-Clock
<p>
It is a digital clock based on my time zone.
I have make use of 2 javascript methods here:
1. addEventListner() : to display clock after the 'clicking' event has occured
2. setInterval(): to keep displaying time at an interval of 1000ms or 1 second
</p>
<p>
In CSS:
1. I have added hover effect on banner "Digital Clock"
2. Cursor chnages to pointer and background-color changes to chocolate upon hovering
3. Made the border round to give it a good visual look
</p>

This is a simple project I have built only to practice basics of javascript and css ,will keep updating it to give it a more classy look .
Problems:
1. I don,t want the clock div to display before clicking on banner, so I will find the solution for this in future.
